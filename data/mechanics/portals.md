Portals are interdimensional doorways between realms. They are used by players to travel between different areas of the game world, and they are also used by NPCs to move between realms. Portals are a key feature of the game, as they allow players to explore new environments, complete quests, and interact with other players.

### Types of Portals

#### Player Portals
Player portals are created by players using special items called portal stones. These stones can be found as loot drops, rewards for completing quests, or purchased from vendors. When a player uses a portal stone, they can create a portal to any location they have previously visited. Other players can then use this portal to travel to the same location.

#### NPC Portals
NPC portals are created by the game world itself, and they are used by NPCs to move between realms. These portals are often found in key locations, such as cities, quest hubs, and dungeons. Players can use these portals to travel to new areas, complete quests, and interact with NPCs.

### Portal Mechanics

#### Activation
To activate a portal, players must interact with it and provide the necessary resources. For player portals, this usually involves using a portal stone. For NPC portals, this may involve completing a quest, defeating a boss, or solving a puzzle.

#### Cooldown
After a portal has been used, it will enter a cooldown period before it can be used again. This prevents players from abusing the portal system and encourages them to explore the game world on foot.

#### Restrictions
Some portals may have restrictions on who can use them. For example, a portal may require a certain level, quest completion, or faction reputation to use. This adds an element of progression and challenge to the portal system.

#### Lore
Portals are an integral part of the game's lore, and they are often tied to the story and history of the game world. Players can learn about the origins and purpose of portals through quests, dialogue, and exploration.

### Portal Quests

#### Portal Activation
Players may be tasked with activating a portal to a new area as part of a quest. This may involve gathering resources, defeating enemies, or solving puzzles to power the portal.

#### Portal Defence
Players may be tasked with defending a portal from enemy attacks as part of a quest. This may involve repelling waves of enemies, repairing the portal, or protecting NPCs as they use the portal.

#### Portal Exploration
Players may be tasked with exploring a new area accessed through a portal as part of a quest. This may involve gathering information, completing objectives, or uncovering secrets in the new environment.

#### Portal Closure
Players may be tasked with closing a portal to prevent enemies from using it as part of a quest. This may involve defeating a boss, destroying the portal, or sealing it with a powerful artefact.

### Portal Rewards
