When a new character enters the gameworld, they begin their journey in the tutorial. This occurs for each and every character created, regardless of whether you have another character and have already completed the tutorial. Some elements may be skipped, but the Main Quest must be completed before you can select a Nature and Class for your character.

The tutorial is a series of quests that introduce the player to the game world, its mechanics, and the lore. It is designed to be a gentle introduction to the game, and to provide players with the basic knowledge they need to start their adventure. The tutorial is also an opportunity for players to learn about the different Natures and Classes available to them, and to make choices that will shape their character and their gameplay experience.

### Tutorial Overview
The tutorial is divided into several stages, each of which focuses on a different aspect of the game. Players will learn about the game world, its inhabitants, and the threats they face. They will also be introduced to the Natures and Classes, and will have the opportunity to make choices that will determine their character's abilities and playstyle. The tutorial will culminate in a series of quests that will test the player's skills and knowledge, and will prepare them for the challenges that await them in the game world.

### Nature
At the end of the tutorial, players will speak to the "Oracle" and be presented with a Nature that fits their choices and actions during the tutorial. The Nature of the player will influence their abilities, strengths, and weaknesses, as well as the classes available to them. There are three Natures in the game:

- **Chaotic Good**: Emphasizes freedom, individuality, and compassion. Players with this Nature have access to classes that focus on agility, speed, and support.

- **Chaotic Neutral**: Emphasizes unpredictability, self-interest, and adaptability. Players with this Nature have access to classes that focus on versatility, cunning, and opportunism.

- **Chaotic Evil**: Emphasizes power, dominance, and ruthlessness. Players with this Nature have access to classes that focus on strength, aggression, and destruction.

The player's Nature will also affect their interactions with NPCs, factions, and other players, as well as the storyline and quests available to them. Players can change their Nature through certain in-game actions and choices, but doing so may have consequences and impact their gameplay experience, as classes are specific to each Nature.

### Class Selection
Once the player has chosen their Nature, they will be presented with a list of classes that are available to them based on their Nature. Each class has its own unique abilities, playstyle, and specializations, allowing players to customize their character to suit their preferences and playstyle. Players can also unlock additional classes through gameplay, achievements, and progression, providing a wide variety of options for character customization and development.

### Tutorial Completion
Once the player has chosen their Nature and Class, they will complete the tutorial and be transported to [Mysteria](mysteria.md), the Capital of Incartum. From there, they will be free to explore, complete quests, and engage in various activities, such as combat, crafting, and socializing with other players. The tutorial is designed to provide players with the basic knowledge they need to start their adventure, and to prepare them for the challenges that await them in the game world.
