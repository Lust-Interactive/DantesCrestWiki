The Nature of the player is determined by the choices they make during the tutorial. The player's Nature will influence their abilities, strengths, and weaknesses, as well as the classes available to them. There are three Natures in the game:

- **Chaotic Good**: Emphasizes freedom, individuality, and compassion. Players with this Nature have access to classes that focus on agility, speed, and support.

- **Chaotic Neutral**: Emphasizes unpredictability, self-interest, and adaptability. Players with this Nature have access to classes that focus on versatility, cunning, and opportunism.

- **Chaotic Evil**: Emphasizes power, dominance, and ruthlessness. Players with this Nature have access to classes that focus on strength, aggression, and destruction.

The player's Nature will also affect their interactions with NPCs, factions, and other players, as well as the storyline and quests available to them. Players can change their Nature through certain in-game actions and choices, but doing so may have consequences and impact their gameplay experience, as classes are specific to each Nature.
