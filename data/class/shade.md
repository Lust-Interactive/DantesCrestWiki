The Shade represents the player's first "class" in the game. Once the player completes the tutorial, they will be able to choose from a variety of classes, each with its own unique abilities and playstyle.

### Class Overview
The Shade is a stealthy, agile, and deadly class that excels at ambushing enemies and dealing high burst damage. They are masters of the shadows, able to move swiftly and silently, and strike from the darkness. The Shade is a versatile class, capable of adapting to various combat situations and excelling in both solo and group play.


### Tutorial
At the end of the tutorial (known coloquially as "Tutorial Island"), the player will be able to select classes based on their [Nature](../mechanics/nature.md).


### Class Selection
Once the player has chosen their Nature, they will be presented with a list of classes that are available to them based on their Nature. Each class has its own unique abilities, playstyle, and specializations, allowing players to customize their character to suit their preferences and playstyle. Players can also unlock additional classes through gameplay, achievements, and progression, providing a wide variety of options for character customization and development.

It is possible to change classes within the game after selecting the initial class and is available once a character has reached Level 15.

The process itself is short enough to not hinder gameplay for players who would like to try something new without re-doing the tutorial on a new character, but long enough to combat players selecting the "easiest to level" class during the tutorial for the sake of fast advancement.
