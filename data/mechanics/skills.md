Each class has a unique range of skills.

## Skill Types

There are 3 different types of skills available to all classes:

### Targetted Skills
These are activated by players and used to target another player, a monster or an area.


### Passive Skills
A Passive Skill is an "always-on" skill that boosts a player's attributes. Once the skill is learned the player will benefit immediatley from it's effects.


### Active Skills
An Active Skill must be used in order for it's effect to be enabled, but will then continue to provide benefits until the player turns it off. It's a cross between Targetted and Passive. In certain situations, forgetting you have an Active Skill enabled could make the difference between life and death.

## Learning Skills

All skills can be learned in the [Castle of Knowledge](../locations/mysteria.md) or from an Instructor located in various Realms. The requirements for learning skills differs skill-by-skill and could require a certain Level be attained, or a certain set of quests be completed.
