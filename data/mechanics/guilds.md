Creating or joining a Guild can be a very rewarding experience.

### Guild Levels
As players earn XP, the Guild also earns XP as a static 1% of all earned XP by the player. This XP is deducted from the player for receiving the following types of XP:

- Monster Kills
- Side Quests

XP is not deducted from the following:

- Main Story Quests
- Item XP Grants

Guilds have Levels which are reached by earning Guild XP (that 1%), which will enable the Guild Leader to select Guild Skills, advancing passive bonuses and allowing the activation of skills during Alliance War. Specific Skills also enable the Guild Storage and Guild Bank, allowing players with the correct permissions to withdraw and/or deposit items/gold for other players to use.

### Guild Skills
Skills:

- Increase Max Members (Levels 1 to 10)
- Enable Portal Contract
- Enable Alliance Access
- Enable Guild Bank
- Enable Guild Storage
- Enable Passive Bonus: Strength (Levels 1 to 5)
- Enable Passive Bonus: Agility (Levels 1 to 5)

### Final Notes:
A separate Chat Tab is available for Guild Chat.

There are 6 Guilds managed by the system which players are able to join freely, or players can apply to join another player-controlled guild, or create their own.

Creating a Player-Controlled Guild costs the player 1,000g multiplied by the number of guilds already created. This means the first Player Guild will cost 6,000g to create.
