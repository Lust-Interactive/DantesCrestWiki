There are two types of currency used within the game.

### In-Game Currency
This type of currency is earned via quests, mechanics or quest rewards.

#### Gold
The main flow of currency through the game is through Gold.

The player HUD displays the value of Gold that the player has on-hand. Gold is used as currency through in-game mechanics. Gold is also used with the banking system.

Players can obtain Gold through a variety of means:

- Selling their items
- Killing monsters
- Rewards for completing certain Achievements
- Rewards for completing certain Quests


#### Other Currencies
Other currencies are used for specific mechanics, such as the Arena, and each Realm may have it's own currency which is used for specific mechanics, but obtained the same way as Gold.


### Cash Shop/Premium Currency
The Cash Shop sells items to the player in exchange for a specific number of Gems. Gems can be purchased for real money via the In-App Purchases layout or via the website.
